// 04 - Copy classes

class User {
    var username = "Anonymous"
}

// If we create one user:
var user1 = User()

// Then we create another one with a copy of
// user 1 and we change the value of username

var user2 = user1
user2.username = "Taylor"

// when printing the values:

print(user1.username)   // Taylor
print(user2.username)   // Taylor

// both values we changed...

// This is a very powerful feature, because itâ€™s what allows us to share common data across all parts of our app. As youâ€™ll see, SwiftUI relies very heavily on classes for its data, specifically because they can be shared so easily.

// If we want to create an unique copy:

class User {
    var username = "Anonymous"

    func copy() -> User {
        let user = User()
        user.username = username
        return user
    }
}
