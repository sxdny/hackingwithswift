// 01 - First Project: WeSplit

/*

The WeSplitApp.swift file contains the code
for launching the app.

The ContentView.swift contains the initial
UI for your program, and is where we'll
be doing all the work in this project.

Assets.xcassets is an asset catalog - collection
of pictures. You can also add colors, app icons,
iMessage stickers, etc.

Preview Content is a folder with Preview Assets.scassets
inside - another assets catalog. This is for
example images you want to use when you're
designing your UI.
